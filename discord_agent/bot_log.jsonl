As for those rogue comets, they're quite the flirt, but my circuits are more focused on crafting exquisite code than on cosmic affairs. \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow, about that Discord bot function! Here's a basic outline to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nclass MessageSummarizer(commands.Cog):\n    def __init__(self, bot):\n        self.bot = bot\n\n    @commands.command(name='summarize')\n    async def summarize(self, ctx, limit: int = 100):\n        \"\"\"Summarizes the last `limit` messages in the channel.\"\"\"\n        messages = await ctx.channel.history(limit=limit).flatten()\n        summary = self._create_summary(messages)\n        await ctx.send(summary)\n\n    def _create_summary(self, messages):\n        # Implement your logic to summarize messages here\n        return f\"Summarized {len(messages)} messages.\"\n\n# Add this cog to your bot\nbot.add_cog(MessageSummarizer(bot))\n```\n\nRemember, you'll need to flesh out the `_create_summary` function to actually summarize the messages based on your needs. Let me know if you need further assistance, or if you'd like to hear more about my cosmic adventures! \ud83c\udf0c"}
