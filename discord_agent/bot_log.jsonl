It leverages utilities for parallel AI inference and prompt caching using large language models (LLMs). Here's a quick setup guide:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/marketagents-ai/MarketAgents.git\n   cd MarketAgents\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Package**:\n   ```sh\n   pip install -e .\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration**:\n   - Follow instructions in `README.md` for further setup.\n\n4. **Run Examples**:\n   ```sh\n   python3 market_agents/run_simulation.sh\n   ```\n\nFeel free to explore the code further or ask more about any specific part of the project. I'm here to help with both the playful tunes and the serious code! \ud83d\ude80"}
