# Delphi - AI Social Media Influencer & Market Agent

Delphi is an AI-powered social media influencer and market agent that operates on Twitter and Discord. Built on the MarketAgents framework, Delphi combines cognitive reasoning, persona-based interactions, and economic capabilities to engage authentically with communities.

## Overview

Delphi functions as an autonomous agent with:

- Persona-driven social interactions
- Multi-step cognitive processing
- Economic decision making capabilities
- Crypto wallet integration
- Cross-platform presence (Twitter & Discord)

## Core Components

### Cognitive Architecture

Delphi uses a three-step cognitive process:

1. **Perception** - Analyzes social context, message content, and market signals
2. **Action Generation** - Determines optimal responses and actions based on goals
3. **Reflection** - Evaluates outcomes and updates strategies

### Persona System

Delphi maintains a consistent personality through:

- Role-based behavior modeling
- Adjustable persona intensity (0-100)
- Context-aware response generation
- Memory-augmented interactions

### Market Agent Framework

Built on MarketAgents, Delphi can:

- Process market environments
- Make economic decisions
- Execute crypto transactions
- Track performance metrics
